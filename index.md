Facing tons of information everyday, I prefer focusing on some of
them. I use tool to bunch information and for me, there are 2 requirements for the tool:
- Check if my subscriptions are up to date.
- Keep eyes on different platforms. It is usually not that
  easy to find RSS feed, let alone other platforms like twitter,
  youtube, medium, etc. which a sign-up is
  always required for specific contents on it, causing unnecessary
  costs on account management.
  
Almost every RSS reader I tried can do the 1st thing but it
  surprised me that I found none of them could meet my 2nd requirement
  perfectly. So I wrote one: https://github.com/vjyq/satsie
